# 🥑 The Guac Stop: Cloud Data Warehouse & Analytics Modernization

## 📌 Overview
This repository presents a complete implementation of a cloud-native data warehousing and analytics solution built for The Guac Stop (TGS) — a global retailer specializing in avocado-based products. The aim was to transform their fragmented and manual data processes by implementing a centralized data warehouse on Oracle Cloud, along with ETL automation and Power BI reporting to support real-time insights and decision-making.
